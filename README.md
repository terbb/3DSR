# What?

3DSR (short for 3D Software Renderer) is intended to be as the title implies, a simple 3D software renderer. 

## Why?

To deepen my understanding of computer graphics and to further sharpen my C++ skills.

## Libraries

- **SDL**
To set up a window and view the results of the rendering in real-time. None of the visuals drawn to the screen will use graphics hardware.

- **tinyobjloader**
To load in .obj files conveniently.

## To-Do


### Basic Set-up
1. ~~Set up `CMakeLists.txt` to build the executable and link in **SDL2**.~~
2. Figure out **tinyobjloader** and include it in the project.
3. Create a window in **SDL2**.
4. Create a basic vector class.
5. Create a basic matrix class.
6. Load `.obj` files.

### Primitive Assembly
7. Draw line segments.
8. Render wireframes of meshes.
9. Draw triangles.
